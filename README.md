# System-Analysis-and-Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

In the DriverPass project, we represented a small consulting company that designs systems for various clients. The client was DriverPass, a newly launched company wanting to provide students competitively packaged driving lesson plans to better prepare them for driving tests at the local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). DriverPass wanted its customers to be able to take online classes and practice tests, while also providing them with on-the-road training if they wish. Using an interview transcript of the clients, conducted by our team leads, we created a business requirements document as well as a system design document with vairous UML diagrams. 

**What did you do particularly well?**

Our team did an excellent job translating the intervi transcript to determine functional and non-functional requirements needed to build the system for the client. Additionally, using process and object diagrams we were able to design a system that the development team would be able to implement with clarity.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

The system design document would be one that could need revision if the developers run into any issues or the client wants to make chages. As it stands, the system design can also undergo some iterations to make sure that the determined diagrams are well designed and improved for maxixmum efficiency. One particular improvement after the initial design is to revise the UML class diagram to include functions along the existing attributes.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

The user needs were interpreted mainly through the interview trascript of the client and hearing their vision for their users. Once those specifications were considered, we implemented a design that woud have a user-friendly interface, and ease of use for all levels.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

Software design begins with planning. During the planning phase there is much analysis that needs to be done. Some analysis uses process diagrams that are useful to work alongside the stakeholder and determine initial needs. Another method of analysis uses object diagrams that are more technical in nature and prepare the system to move into the design phase where requirements can be laid out for the developers. Two important documents to use are the business requirement and the system design document.
